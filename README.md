# Decentralized Specialized Handmade Jewelry Verification

A blockchain-based system for authenticating handcrafted jewelry through verification of artisans, materials, designs, and ownership provenance.

## Overview

This project implements a decentralized verification system for handmade jewelry using smart contracts to ensure authenticity and provide transparent provenance tracking. The system consists of four primary contract components:

1. **Artisan Verification**: Validates legitimate jewelry makers through credential verification
2. **Material Certification**: Documents the authenticity of precious metals and gemstones
3. **Design Registration**: Records details of original designs and prevents unauthorized reproduction
4. **Provenance Tracking**: Maintains chain of custody from creation through each owner

## Core Components

### Artisan Verification Contract
- Validates credentials of jewelry artisans
- Provides unique digital identifiers for verified makers
- Manages reputation metrics based on verification status and history

### Material Certification Contract
- Documents origins and authenticity of precious metals
- Verifies gemstone quality and sourcing
- Links physical materials to digital certificates

### Design Registration Contract
- Timestamps original jewelry designs
- Records unique characteristics and specifications
- Protects intellectual property of artisans

### Provenance Contract
- Tracks ownership history from creation to current owner
- Documents transfers between parties
- Provides immutable record of a piece's journey
